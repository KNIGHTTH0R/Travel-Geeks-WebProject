Travel Diary, made with php,javascript,html and css for web technology project.The website is intended to be similar as an Imageboard, such as 4chan. There are two roles, simple user and admin. The admin and regular user privileges are different. 
I continue to develop and improve this in my free time. This project has solely been done by me even though I had group mates assigned.
